# hangman-game
### Overview
This is a simple Hangman game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to guess the hidden word by entering letters. For every incorrect letter guessed, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends when either the full hangman is drawn (game over) or the player successfully guesses the entire word.

## How to Play
1- **Start the Game**: The game begins with a series of input squares representing the letters of a hidden word.

2- **Guess a Letter**: Enter a letter to guess. 
  - If the letter is correct, it will appear in the correct position(s) of the word. 
  - If the letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman is drawn (stand, rope, head, body, hands, and legs).

3- **Strategy**: Think carefully before guessing.
  - Common letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) can be good initial guesses, while less common letters can be saved for later attempts.

4- **Winning the Game**: Successfully guess all the letters in the word before the hangman is fully drawn.

5- **Game Over**: If the hangman is fully drawn, the game ends.

## Features
  - **Dynamic Hangman Drawing**: The hangman is drawn progressively with each incorrect guess.
  - **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can input their guesses and receive immediate feedback.

## Technologies Used
  - **HTML**: Structure of the game.
  - **CSS**: Styling and layout.
  - **JavaScript**: Game logic and interactivity.
